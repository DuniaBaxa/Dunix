# Notes about Pandunia
 
This page contains mixed notes that I have written down. They deal with all kinds of questions about Pandunia. Some of the notes can be moved to more appropriate documents later, such as the grammar or questions and answers page.
 
 
### Word building

<small>2018-08-29</small>
 
Esperanto's mal- prefix means something that is at the opposite end of a continuum. For example, there is a continuum of temperature from cold to hot (malvarma, varma) and there is a continuum of beaty from ugly to beatiful (malbona, bona). A bad side of this idea is that one extreme has to be selected as the unprefixed norm.
 
That's why I prefer another way, which uses degree words and neutral nouns. Examples:
 
**bon rupi** = good-looking i.e. beautiful or handsome  
**mal rupi** = bad-looking i.e. ugly  
 
**day badani** = big-bodied i.e. large  
**lil badani** = little-bodied i.e. small  
 
In fact these are sequences of two modifiers where the first one modifies the second one. So basically the sequence is adverb + adjective.
 
On the other hand, **rup-bon** and **badan-day** are not possible compound words in Pandunia, because it's not possible to combine a noun to a modifier. That's because the modifier always modifies the noun and never the other way round.
 
However, it's possible to say:
 
**rupi bon** = looking-wise good  
**badani day** = body-wise big, bodily big, corpulent  
 
 
### Word changes

I noticed the conflict between help and medium. That's why help was **mede** and medium was **midi** so they have different vowels. However, it's better to use **helpe** as the word for help and **medi** as the word for medium.
 
The call for help should be internationally recognized and English "help" is most widely known (besides international calls for help, S.O.S. and mayday).
 
**helpa mi!** = Help me!
 
### Speech sounds

<small>2018-08-30</small>
 
Voiced sibilants, stops and affricates are not allowed in end of word position. Therefore "dez" is impossible word for Pandunia.


### Possessives and "zero be"

<small>2018-09-08</small>

There is a reason why **mi buke** is not possessive construction and it has to do with word order variation.

**mi buke dugu.** = I read the book.

Here **mi** is the subject, **buke** is the object and **dugu** is the verb. The word order is subject–verb–object.

**mi ya buke dugu.** = My book is read.

Here **mi ya buke** is the object and the word order is object–verb (i.e. the word order of the "passive" sentence).

So, if **mi buke** would mean "my book", then **mi buke dugu** could mean either of the above mentioned things. That's why the simple possessive structure of **mi buke** is excluded from Pandunia and only **mi ya buke** is used.

However, so called _zero be_ structure is possible because it is used only in short sentences.

**ce buke.** = That (is) the book.  
**mi maria.** = I (am) Maria.

These sentences are short and complete. That's why they work.

If you add there a verb ending in -u, then it's not a zero be structure anymore but rather a sentence with SOV word order.

**mi maria vidu.** = I see Maria.


### Why there are two forms of ce, le and ke

<small>2018-09-09</small>

There is a similar reason behind the two forms of demonstrative pronouns (**ce/ci** and **le/li**) and the interrogative pronoun (**ke/ki**).

**ci apel nyamu.** = This apple is eaten.  
**ce apel nyamu.** = This eats the apple.

So here the first sentence uses object–verb word order, where **ci apel** (this apple) is the object. But in the second sentence the word order is subject–object–verb and **ce** is the subject and only **apel** is the object.

You can even say **ce ci apel nyamu.** = This eats this apple. The same sentence in the more common SVO word order would be **ce nyama ci apel.**


### Titles

<small>2018-10-30</small>

It's polite to use titles when talking about people. Western languages often use gender-specific words like *mister* and *señor* (for men) and *miss* and *señora* (for women). East Asian languages use so called honorifics, like Japanese *san* and *sama*.

In Pandunia you can use the word **onori** (meaning *honorable, respected*) for all genders.

**onori maria ernandes** - Ms. Maria Hernandez  
**onori yusef malik** - Mr. Yusef Malik


### Calculating in Pandunia

<small>2018-10-30</small>

How to multiply in Pandunia? Interestingly, you can use numbers as modifiers of verbs of calculation.

**mi dul mara car.**  
_I two-ly multiply four._  
I multiply two and four.

**mi dul fena car.**  
_I two-ly divide four._  
I divide four by two.

2 × 4 = 8  
**dul mara car egala bat.**  
Two times four equals eight.

6 / 2 = 3  
**sis fenu dul egala sam.**  
Six divided by two equals three.



### Suffixes for word building

<small>2018-11-29</small>

- **-ia** means an area or space and it can be used for both physical and abstract things.
- **-er** means an agent of the action
- **-iste** means one who supports to a particular idea, such as a religious doctrine or a political movement.

Note that both **-er** and **-iste** are used in a more narrow sense than similar English suffixes _-er_ and _-ist_. For example, _a guitarist_ is an agent and not a supporter, so it translates to **gitarer** in Pandunia, not **gitariste**.

We can combine the above-mentioned suffixes together.

- **-eria** is the trade or the place where the action takes place
- **-istia** is the ideology or religion that is supported

For example, we can derive **budistia** _(Buddhism)_ from **budiste** _(Buddhist)_. So we don't need or use the suffix _-ism_ at all.

In general, it is preferred in Pandunia that we follow the internal logic of the language instead of external models such as the Western languages.

Another example of this are the words **nasiste** _(nationalist)_ and **sociste** _(socialist)_. The word stems are **nas-** _(nation, folk)_ and **soc-** _(society)_. There's no need to add anything between them and the suffix **-iste** because the meaning is already complete. So, while these words look a little different than in the Western languages, their meaning is clear and complete.
