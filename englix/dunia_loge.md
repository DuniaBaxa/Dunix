World Words
===========

Cultures of the world
---------------------

Hartmut Traunmuller divided the world into four major cultural spheres in his article [A Universal Interlanguage: Some Basic Considerations](http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/UIL.pdf). The languages within a certain cultural sphere share words (loan words and translated loan words) and cultural concepts. The four major cultural spheres are:

1. The European (Western) cultural sphere
2. The Afro-Asian (Islamic) cultural sphere
3. The South Asian (Indian) cultural sphere
4. The East Asian (Chinese) cultural sphere

They are roughly outlined in the picture below.

Samuel P. Huntington presented a division of the humankind into civilizations in his famous book _The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order_ (1996). His division matches Traunmuller's division by and large. According to Huntington, civilization is the highest rank of cultural identity of people. It is defined by language, history, religion, customs and institutions.

| Civilization     | Geographic area                       | Religion                        | Primeval language |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Eastern Orthodox | East Europe and North Asia            | Eastern Orthodox Christianity   | Greek             |
| Western          | Europe, North America and Australasia |Catholic and Protest Christianity| Latin             |
| Latin American   | South and Central America             | Catholic Christianity           | Latin             |
| African          | Sub-Saharan Africa                    | African Christianity            | -                 |
| Islamic          | North Africa and South Asia           | Islam                           | Arabic            |
| Hindu            | Indian Subcontinent                   | Hinduism                        | Sanskrit          |
| Buddhist         | Indochina, Sri Lanka, Tibet           | Theravada Buddhism              | Pali              |
| Sinitic          | China, Korea and Vietnam              | Confucianism                    | Middle Chinese    |
| Japanese         | Japan                                 | Shintoism and Buddhism          | Middle Chinese    |
| Lone countries   | Ethiopia                              | Ethiopian Christianity          | Ge'ez             |
|                  | Israel                                | Judaism                         | Hebrew            |
|                  | Haiti                                 | Catholicism and Vodou           | -                 |

These kinds of classifications are always questionable because they are over-generalized. However they help us to understand that there are many well-developed and deep-rooted cultures in the world.

It is generally agreed that language and culture are closely related. Language can be viewed as a verbal expression of culture. It is necessary to consider all cultures and all international vocabularies in the making of a global language.


Regional auxiliary languages
----------------------------

Many constructed auxiliary languages are based almost exclusively on the Western vocabulary, which stems from Greek and Latin. Such languages can be called Europe centric languages, Eurocentric languages or eurolangs in short. These languages rarely – if ever – go beyond the Western languages in search for new words. Some of the most widely known auxiliary languages are eurolangs:

- Esperanto (published in Imperial Russia in 1887)
- Ido (France, 1907)
- Occidental/Interlingue (Estonia, 1922)
- Novial (Denmark, 1928)
- Interlingua (USA, 1951)
- Lingua Franca Nova (USA, 1966)
- Glosa (UK, 1972)

Some eurolangs even try to be understandable "at first sight", which is only possible if the language resembles some existing language very much. Often the goal was to look like Latin or some modern Latinate language like Italian. However all of these languages have failed to become popular in their home ground, the West, and it is unlikely that any other part of the world would adopt them.

Some auxiliary languages have been created for other regions such as Afrihili for Africa.


Global auxiliary languages
--------------------------

Languages with global scope have also been created. This heterogeneous type of languages is called **worldlangs** in the auxiliary language circle. Some of the most notable worldlangs are listed [here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html). Pandunia is one of the more developed worldlangs.


How words are selected to Pandunia
----------------------------------

Pandunia's words come from some of the most widely spoken languages of the world. There is a methodology for selecting words. The three key criteria for selecting words are:

- **Equality** : Words are be borrowed equally from different regions of the world. In practice it means that Pandunia has words from the languages of Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa.
- **Prevalence** : Widely spread words are favored. The more people know the word the better.
- **Simplicity** : Word forms with easy pronunciation are favored.


Words of Pandunia come from the following _language pools_. Each pool includes 500-900 million people!

1. Latinate languages : The languages in this group are descendants of Latin of the Roman Empire. They are very similar to each other. The languages in this group include Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian.
2. Other Western languages : This groups includes the remaining Western languages. Most of them have been influenced greatly by Greek and Latin. The languages in this group include English, German, Russian, Polish and many others. English is the single most important language in this group.
3. West Asian and North African languages : This group includes Arabic, Turkish, Persian and other languages of this region. The languages in this group have influenced each other and they have had a great impact on languages of the surrounding regions.
4. Sub-Saharan African languages : This group includes most languages of Africa. More than two thousand languages are spoken in Africa, but there some major cross-border languages (Swahili, Hausa, Lingala) and other major languages (Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Yoruba). Many languages in this group have been influenced by Arabic, English, French or Portuguese.
5. Indo-Aryan languages : The languages in this group are descendants of Sanskrit. This group includes Hindi, Bangla, Urdu and many other languages of Northern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Perso-Arabic and English have left their print on this group.
6. South Asian languages : This incoherent group includes the languages of South India, Indo-China and Austronesia. They have been influenced by Sanskrit and Pâli and also Perso-Arabic and Chinese to a lesser extent.
7. Mandarin Chinese : Mandarin Chinese has more native speakers than any other language and therefore it is considered a group on its own.
8. Other East Asian languages : This group includes other Chinese languages, such as Cantonese, Shanghaiese and Taiwanese, and also neighbouring languages, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese, which have been saturated by Chinese loan words.

In practice many words are shared by two or more language pools. Pandunia favors international, intercontinental and global words. 


## Examples

### Example: Selecting the word for "language"

First possible candidates are searched from widely spoken languages. The search reveals that there are several words that are international.

- Arabic لغة /luɣa/ is also known in Swahili _lugha_. It is also known in Persian and Turkic languages but with the meaning "dictionary".
- Persian زبان /zæba:n/ has spread to Urdu and Punjabi among others.
- Latinate _lingua_ is found in the Romance languages and it has spread to most European languages in words like _linguistics_ and _multilingual_.
- Indo-Aryan भाषा /bʱaʂa/ is used in Hindi and Bangla and it has spread to several neighbouring languages including Telugu, Thai and Indonesian.

The most prevalent of these words is /bʱaʂa/. It is recognised nearly everywhere in India, Indochina and Malay archipelago, which are some of the most densely populated areas in the world.

| Language   | Spoken word  | Written word    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Hindi      | bʱaʂa        | भाषा          |
| Punjabi    | bʱaʃa         | ਭਾਸ਼ਾ          |
| Gujarati   | bʱaʃa        | ભાષા          |
| Marathi    | bʱaɕa        | भाषा          |
| Bangla     | bʱaʃa        | ভাষা           |
| Telugu     | baʃa         | భాష          |
| Thai       | pʰa:sa:      | ภาษา         |
| Indonesian | bahasa       | bahasa          |
| Javanese   | basa         | basa            |
| Sundanese  | basa         | basa            |

As you can see, the same word is written and pronounced differently in different languages. This is typical of international words. They get adapted. Likewise it is necessary to adapt this word to the spelling and pronunciation rules of Pandunia. So the Pandunia word for language becomes **bax**.
