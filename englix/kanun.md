# Grammar

## 0. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in
Pandunia.  However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading
this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a
dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to
learn when the student must learn to make distinctions that he is not
used to making.  That's why students have difficulties with things
like irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones,
noun/adjective agreement, honorific inflection, consonant and vowel
harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. It doesn't have any of
the previously mentioned complexities. Instead, it has a simple
grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic
spelling.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a
strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a
"wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself
understood. Consequently, much of the language involves the lexical
items (words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat"), and very little
involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and
tenses).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. The basic rules

These are the 11 basic rules of Pandunia language.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of
   the word.
3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
4. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form. They come before
   the word that they modify.
    - ex. 1. **gude supe** = Good soup.
    - ex. 2. **Yu gude toke.** = You speak well.
5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
    - ex. **poste** (mail) + **bokse** (box) → **poste bokse** (mailbox)
6. Preposition **da** marks the direct object when it is a noun phrase.
    - ex. **Mi nyam da supe.** = I eat soup.
8. Verbs do not change for person or number.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **Mi plis yu give da mone.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **Mi aske yu baxa da Dunix?** → **Aske yu baxa da Dunix?**
      = Do you speak Dunish?
    - **Mi plis yu toke klar.** →  **Plis toke klar.**
      = Please speak clearly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns
are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in
definite and indefinite, etc.

**petre** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kursi** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**wade** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified
earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the
word **sole** refers to _the sun_ and **lune** refers to _the moon_, our
only sun and our only moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in
singular and plural. Number can be mentioned with number words when
it is needed.

**kursi** - a chair or chairs  
**en kursi** - one chair  
**du kursi** - two chairs  
**tri kursi** - three chairs  
**muce kursi** - a lot of chairs; chairs

If the number is not mentioned, there are different possibilities.

1. The number is not important.
2. The number is not known.
3. The number is already known. (It has been already been mentioned.)

**Yu have da kide?**
– Do you have a child / children?

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

**petre petre**
– stones, lots of stones  
**tara tara**
– stars, lots of stars  


### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine
and/or neuter categories).

Some words carry _natural gender_. For example **fem** (woman) is
feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

### 2.4. Compounds

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **sole guang** - sunlight  
> **luna guang** - moonlight  
> **luna petre** - moonstone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to the
thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun. In
Pandunia an adjective is a modifier that is before a noun.

**day petre** - big stone
**bare petre** - heavy stone  
**day meza** - big table  
**hay meza** - high table  
**gude kursi** - good chair

When adjective can be also after the noun. Often this type of phrases
can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**petre day.** - The stone is big.  
**meza hay.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**day meza hay.** - Big table is high.

### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia an adverb is a modifier that is before a verb or at the
end of the sentence.

> **Mi _gude_ sona.** - I well sleep.  
> **Mi sona _gude_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **Yu baxa da dunix _gude_.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.

### 3.3. Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier. For example **day** (big)
and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

> **day wan** - big person  
> **lil wan** - little person  
> **byuti wan** - beautiful person

> **day byuti wan** - very beautiful person  
> **lil byuti wan** - somewhat beautiful person

The modifiers can be separated by using **e** (and).

> **lil e byuti wan** - a little and beautiful person

### 3.4. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **more** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **moste** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **les** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **leste** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sam** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **dan** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of
comparison.

**Mi is mor gude dan yu.**
= I am better than you.  
**Yu toke sam gude dan mi.**
= You speak as well as me.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken
about. For example, the word **sole** (sun) normally refers to just one
sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They
are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**en xing** - one star  
**du xing** - two stars  
**tri xing** - three stars  
**xaw xing** - few stars  
**muce xing** - many stars

**en day kursi** - one big chair  
**du day kursi** - two big chairs  
**tri gude kursi** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

**fen en** - the first part (part one)
**fen du** - the second part (part two)
**fen tri** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **ow**
- 1 **en**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **tri**
- 4 **for**
- 5 **fay**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **sen**
- 8 **ey**
- 9 **nay**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of
mathematics.

- 10 **en ow** or **ten**
- 11 **en en**
- 12 **en du**
- 13 **en tri**
- 20 **du ow**
- 21 **du en**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **en ow ow** or **hon**
- 101 **en ow en** or **hon en**
- 200 **du ow ow** or **du hon**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the
International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple
of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    

## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

**mi** - I, me  
**tu** - you (singular)  
**ha** - he, she, it  
**wi** - we  
**yu** - you (plural or polite)  
**de** - they

### 5.2. Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the
same as the subject.

**selfe** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **selfe** is used for all persons, so it
corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_,
_itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**Mi si selfe.**
– I see myself.  
**Ha si selfe.**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**Wi si selfe.**
– We see ourselves.  

### 5.3. Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronoun is:

**ce** - this/that one

**Mi wante dis.**
– I want this one.  
**Ha wante dat.**
– He/she wants that one.  


### 5.4. Interrogative pronouns

**Wa** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of
English words _who_ and _what_.

> **wa?** - Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **wa** and it meanst the same
as English _which_.

**wa ting?** - What? (Which thing?)  
**wa wan?** - Who? (Which person?)  
**wa zaman?** - When? (What time?)  
**wa yang?** - How? (What manner?)  

Adjectives are questioned with **wa**.

**wa day?** - How big?  
**wa lil?** - How small?  
**wa day da maw yu have?** - How big cat do you have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

#### 6.1. General

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to
look and to think.


### 6.3. Passive sentences

In passive sentence there is only object and verb but no subject (i.e.
agent).

**Mi bey si.**
– I am seen.  
**Pan bey beke.**
– Bread is baked.  
**Kope bey krax.**
– Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 7.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type. They may consist of only
one word, which draws the listener's attention to it.

> **maw!** - A cat!  
> **barxa!** - (It) rains!  

### 7.2. Stative Sentences

#### 7.2.1. With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the
simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the
predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**Mi gude.** - I am good.  
**ha nyu.** - It is new.  
**ha sarah.** - She is Sarah.  
**sarah gude.** - Sarah is good.  
**petre day.** - The stone is big.  
**meza nyu.** - The table is new.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

**Mi no gude.** - I'm not good.  
**ha no nyu.** - It's not new.  
**ha no sarah.** - She is not Sarah.

It is possible to add the word **si** (yes) before the predicate in
positive sentences, for style or for convenience. Then the structure
is similar like in negative sentences.

**sarah si gude.** - Sarah is good.  
**petre si day.** - The stone is big.  
**meza si nyu.** - The table is new.  
**meza no law.** - The table is not old.

Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **no**.

**Mi si ha.** - I am he/she.  
**Mi no yu.** - I'm not you.


#### 7.2.2. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

**yong si byuti.** - Young is beautiful.  
**nyu no law.** - New is not old.  

#### 7.2.3. With verb subject

A verb can't be subject as such. So the verb is first, use **ce**
to start a comment about the verb.

**canta, ce gude.** = Singing, that is good. (Singing is good.)


#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.

### 7.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb
(i.e. an action-word). In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because
all of them end in **-a** or **-o**.

Active sentences have the
subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

**Mi nyam da aple.**
– I eat apples.  
**Mi audi da musike.**
– I hear music.  
**Mi si yu.**
– I see you.


### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  subject – verb 1 – object
1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role. It is at the same time the object
for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

**Mi wante yu nyam da veje.** - I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi wante** has **yu** as its object. At the same
time, **yu** functions as the subject of the following predicate,
**nyam da veje**. So **yu** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

### 7.7. Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by
the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in
series.
 
1. **Mi gowa ta dom.** - I go home.  
2. **Mi kan gowa ta dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **Mi wante kan gowa ta dom.** - I want to be able to go home.
   (Word by word: _I want can go to home_!)

### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**Mi aske yu baxa da dunix.** - I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
**Aske yu baxa da dunix?** - Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

**Mi plis yu kom ta dom.** - I ask you to come home.  
**Plis kom ta dom!** - Please come home! (Literally: _Request come home!_)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **e** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **o** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or
   contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

**Mi suku da maw e waf.** - I like cats and dogs.  
**Mi suku da maw o waf.** - I like cats or dogs.  
**Mi suku da maw a no waf.** - I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles

### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **ye** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **ye** affirms
the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it.

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **ye** is not
always necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions
of state.

**Mi is wan.** - I am a person.  
**Ha is nyu meza.** - It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**Mi no wan.** - I'm not a person.  
**Ha no nyu meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the
negative word.

**Mi si yu.** - I see you.  
**Mi no si yu.** - I don't see you.  
**Mi si no yu a de.** - I see, not you, but them.

**Mi plis yu klin da rum.**
= I ask you to clean the room.  
**Mi no plis yu klin da rum.**
= I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**Mi plis yu no klin da rum.**
= I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The particles **ye** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

**Aske yu si mi?** - Do you see me?  
**Ye. (Mi ye si yu.)** - Yes. (I do see you.)  
**No. (Mi no si yu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that **si** and **no** apply to the
verb, not the whole question.

**Aske yu no si mi?** - Don't you see me?  
**Ye. (Mi ye si yu.)** - Yes. (I do see you.)  
**No. (Mi no si yu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)

### 9.2. Modifier particles

Particles **se** and **of** are used to mark possession and
modification.  **se** connects the modifying word or phrase to the
modified word. **of** works in the opposite direction. It connects the
modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **da** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in
English.

**maria da mama** - Maria's mother  
**mi's dom** - my house  
**mi's papa da dom** - my father's house

**of** works like "of" in English.

**mama of maria** - the mother of Maria  
**dom of me** - the house of mine  
**dom of papa of me** - the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other
words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and
the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that
consists of two or more words.

**roze rang da labe** - rose-colored lips  
**saman rang da yen** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labe of roze rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
**yen of saman rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**en sake da patate** - one sack of potatos  
**du sake da patate** - two sacks of potatos  
**mor sake da patate** - more sacks of potatos
 
Note that **da** and **of** connect phrases together. So a modifier
phrase with and without **da** can mean a different thing.

**mor byuti pul** - more beautiful flowers  
**mor da byuti pul** - more of beautiful flowers

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **of** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_,
_that_, _who_ and _whom_.

**ha si man _of me si_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object
(i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied
subject of the relative clause.

**Mi si man _of nyam aple_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  

It's possible to construct relative clauses with **da** too. Then the
relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. The verb is turned
into a modifier by putting **da** immediately after the verb.

**Mi si _aple nyamu da_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.

**buke dugu da wan in rum.** = The book-reading person is in the room.  
**ha duga da buke in meza.** = The book, that he/she reads, is on the table.

### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in
relation to the listener. Modal particles are commonly used in many
languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use
famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the
whole sentence, when the modal particle is the last word in the
sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions
much like in English.

**ha nyam bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
**ha nyam plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
**ha plus nyam bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
**plus ha nyam bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.

### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases
if needed. The general time words are **pas** (past), **zay**
(present) and **wil** (future, upcoming). They function like
adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**Mi pas have da maw.** - I had cats.
**a me no zay have da maw.** - But I now don't have cats.
**munkin me wil have da maw.** - Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **in pase** (in the
past) etc.

**Mi have da maw in pase.** - I had cats in the past.  
**a me no have da maw in zaye.** - But I don't have cats at present.  
**munkin me have da maw in wile.** - Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **have** stayed the same in
all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it
is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **in** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **of** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **ta** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**Mi in hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
**Mi sona in hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
**Mi sona of xam ta suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
**Mi safar of london ta paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**Mi denga of yu gowa.** - I have waited since you left.  
**Mi denga ta yu kom ta dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
**Mi denga in yu sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### 10.1.2. in

**in** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**Mi stasa in dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**Mi toke in dunix.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**Mi toke in doste in dunix in fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia in telephone.


### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Preposition **as** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**Mi now da dunix as guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**as** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **now** (know) is the verb and **guru** (master) is
the point of comparison.


### 10.3. Preposition of comparison

**Dan** is used when adjectives are compared.

**Kide is les day dan papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
**Law papa is sam day dan papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**Dan** relates the adverbs of comparison – **mor** (more), **les**
(less) and **sam** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**papa** (father) in the examples above.



## 11. Word Building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a
productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are
used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come
from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.
