# Spelling of Pandunia

The Basic Latin alphabet is used for writing Pandunia.  Here is the alphabet of
Pandunia followed by the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

| Pandunia: | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | r | s | t | u | w | x | y | z |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Pandunia, like Spanish, is pronounced exactly as it is spelt. No letter is
silent. Every letter has one sound, always the same.

## Consonant Sounds

    p  b  f     m  w
    t  d  s  z  n  l  r
    c  j  x        y
    k  g  h

Most consonants are pronounced same as in English. So pronunciation of
**b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, t, w, z** is familiar and easy.

The following consonants are pronounced differently in Pandunia than in English.

- **g** is always hard like in _girl, get_.
- **r** is preferably trilled like in Scottish English or the rr in Spanish
  _carro_. Also other pronunciations are acceptable, including the standard
  English /ɹ/. Note that **r** is never silent!
- **s** is always voiceless like in _sissy_. **z** is voiced like in _zoo_.
- **x** is always pronounced like SH in _ship_.
- **c** is pronounced like CH in _chip_.
- **j** is pronounced like the English J.
- **n** is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations **nk**
  and **ng**, where it is velar /ŋ/ like in _banker_ and _finger_. In the end
  of a word, the **g** in **ng** can be silent. So the word **pang** can be
  pronounced /paŋ/ as well as /paŋg/.


## Semivowels

Semivowels **y** and **w** are pronounced like in English.
As semivowels **y** is close to **i** sound and **w** is close to
**u** sound.

Semivowels **y** and **w** are always followed by a full vowel or
a word break (when the bare word stem is used). For example:  
**maw tena naw jiwe.** = The cat has nine lives.


## Vowel Sounds

Pandunia has five vowels.

    i   u
    e   o
      a

They are pronounced as follows: **a** like in _palm_, **e** like in
_hey_, **i** like in _machine_, **o** like in _boy_ and **u** like in
_rude_. They are pure vowels, so their quality doesn't change over
the duration of the vowel.


## Gliding Vowels

When two vowels are next to each other, they will glide together and
form a _diphthong_ i.e. a gliding vowel.

For example **a** and **u** form a gliding vowel in the word **paus**.
So the vowel begins in **a** and glides gradually to **u**.
There is a similar gliding vowel in **paw**.


## Stress Accent

The stress is on the syllable, which is before the last consonant.

Consider the following examples:

- **maw** /máw/, beng /béng/
- **komun** /komún/, **bazar** /bazár/, **kamis** /kamís/, **sofah** /sofáh/
- **nowi** /nówi/, **musike** /musíke/, **arabi** /arábi/
- **dunia** /dúnia/, **arabia** /arábia/

     dunia si momi sundar planete.  
    /dúnia sí mómi sundár planéte./

     me wanta loga komun bax, le si pandunia.  
    /mé wánta lóga komún báx, lé sí pandúnia./

     darsogur sida sa sofah.  
    /dársogúr sída sá sofáh/


## Letter Case

Pandunia is normally written only in small letters (i.e. lower case letters).
Large letters are not used in general, although they are not forbidden either.

There are three reasons why large letters and rules about their usage
are not needed.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital sounds" in speech in
   beginning of proper names etc.
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter type.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters. No need for rules and exceptions.

Note! It's not a mistake to use the capital letters. Sometimes people do it
because they are used to them in other languages. But still capital letters are
unnecessary and not recommended.

Capital letters are used in standard international acronyms. For example: 10 Mb
(des megobite), 100 Gb (hon gigobite), 2 mm (dul milometre), 1 kJ (un kilojul).


## Syllabification

[-] Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen. The hyphen is placed
between spoken syllables. For example: bin, ka-fe, yu-mor, pos-ta.


## Punctuation

[.] All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

[?] Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

[!] Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

[...] Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) may be used to indicate incomplete sentence or
uncertainty.

[:] Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation or a list.

[,] Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

In informal texts smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**me wida te :)**
= I see you.  
**me ni wida te :(**
= I don't see you.
