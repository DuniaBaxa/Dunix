## Consonant Sounds

    p  b  f  v  m  w
    t  d  s  z  n  l  r
    c  j  x        y
    k  g  h

Most consonants are pronounced same as in English. So pronunciation of
**b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, t, w, z** is familiar and easy.

The following consonants are pronounced differently in Dunish than in English.

- **g** is always hard like in _girl, get_.
- **r** is preferably trilled like in Scottish English or the rr in Spanish
  _carro_. Also other pronunciations are acceptable, including the standard
  English /…π/. Note that **r** is never silent!
- **s** is always voiceless like in _sissy_. **z** is voiced like in _zoo_.
- **x** is always pronounced like SH in _ship_.
- **c** is pronounced like CH in _chip_.
- **j** is pronounced like the English J.
- **n** is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations **nk**
  and **ng**, where it is velar /≈ã/ like in _banker_ and _finger_. In the end
  of a word, the **g** in **ng** can be silent. So the word **ting** can be
  pronounced /ti≈ã/ as well as /ti≈ãg/.


## Semivowels

Semivowels **y** and **w** are pronounced like in English.
As semivowels **y** is close to **i** sound and **w** is close to
**u** sound.


## Vowel Sounds

Dunish has five vowels.

    i   u
    e   o
      a

They are pronounced as follows: **a** like in _palm_, **e** like in
_hey_, **i** like in _machine_, **o** like in _boy_ and **u** like in
_rude_. They are pure vowels, so their quality doesn't change over
the duration of the vowel.

When **e** is the last sound in a polysyllabic word, it can be
very weak, like a schwa sound. So for example **buke** (book) may
be pronounced /buk…ô/.


## Gliding Vowels

When two vowels are next to each other, they will glide together and
form a _diphthong_ i.e. a gliding vowel.

For example **a** and **u** form a gliding vowel in the word **haus**
(house).
So the vowel begins in **a** and glides gradually to **u**.
There is a similar gliding vowel in **naw** (now).


## Stress Accent

The stress is on the first syllable of every word.

Consider the following examples:

- **maw** /m√°w/, **ting** /t√≠≈ã/
- **komun** /k√≥mun/, **bazar** /b√°zar/, **sofa** /s√≥fa/
- **musike** /m√∫sike/, **arabi** /√°rabi/
- **dunia** /d√∫nia/

     Dunia is wi's byuti planete.  
    /d√∫nia √≠s w√≠s  by√∫ti pl√°nete./

     Mi wante toke komun baxa, ha is Dunix.  
    /M√≠ w√°nt…ô t√≥k…ô k√≥mun b√° Éa, h√° √≠s d√∫ni É./


## Letter Case

Both small and large letters (i.e. lower and upper case letters) can
be used for writing Dunish, but it's also acceptable to use only
small letters for simplicity.

The capitalization rules are simple:

1. The first letter of a name is large.
2. The first letter of a sentence is large.

There are three reasons why large letters and rules about their usage
are unnecessary.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital sounds" in speech in
   beginning of proper names etc.
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter type.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters. No need for rules and exceptions.


## Syllabification

[-] Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen. The hyphen is placed
between spoken syllables. For example: bin, ka-fe, yu-me, pos-te.


## Punctuation

[.] All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

[?] Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

[!] Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

[...] Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) may be used to indicate incomplete sentence or
uncertainty.

[:] Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation or a list.

[,] Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

In informal texts smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**Mi love yu :)**
= I love you.  
**Yu no love mi :(**
= You don't love me.

Emojis can be used too.

**Mi love yu üòä**
= I love you.  
**Yu no love mi ‚òπ**
