## Correlatives

> Correlatives are the words used to ask questions which require specific answers -- the "who, what, when, where, how" of a language, and their general answers ("there, here, everywhere, nowhere, somewhere").  
> -- [Don Harlow](http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/correlatives.html)

In Pandunia the "correlatives" are built from separate words in a logical manner. Each "correlative" consists of a determiner and a noun.

The determiners are independent words. Basically it's an open class of words, so also other words can be used to create new "correlatives". Anyway, the most frequent determiners are listed below.

> **ke** - what? which?  
> **sa** - this, that  
> **yo** - some  
> **mei** - every, each, all  
> **nul** - none  

Basic category nouns are:

> **ren** - person  
> **xe** - thing  
> **yang** - kind, type  
> **lok** - place  
> **sat** - time, moment  

These determiners and category nouns can be combined into this table of correlatives.

## Years, months and days

Pandunia uses the international standard (ISO 8601) as the default system of expressing the date.

The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. For example the date of writing this is 2018-02-21. It is said in Pandunia **nen 2018 mes 2 dia 21.

"iso mes un" (ISO month 1)?
"gregor mes un" (Gregorian month one)
islam mes noi = Ramadan

We can say like this: iso nen 2018. Or "putong nen 2018" because that's the universal way to mark years.
bahai u baha nen 175?
